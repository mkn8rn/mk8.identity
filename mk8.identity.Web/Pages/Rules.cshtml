Do not exploit, publicise, or distribute vulnerabilities before they are resolved.</li>
            <li class="mb-2"><strong>No Abuse of Bugs:</strong> You may not exploit bugs, glitches, or unintended behaviour for personal gain or to disrupt the service. This includes circumventing access controls, manipulating contribution records, or bypassing restrictions.</li>
            <li class="mb-2"><strong>No Illegal Content:</strong> You may not submit, store, or transmit any content that is illegal under applicable law. This includes but is not limited to: content that infringes intellectual property rights, facilitates illegal activity, or constitutes harassment or threats.</li>
            <li class="mb-2"><strong>No Service Abuse:</strong> You may not use the service in any way that degrades its availability or performance for others. This includes automated access without permission, spam, denial-of-service attempts, or excessive resource consumption.</li>

            <div class="card-body">
                <p class="text-muted small">These rules apply to rooms on matrix.mkn8rn.com that are not federated.</p>

                <h6>0. Moderation Process</h6>
                <p>Moderators will present warnings in private before permanent actions are taken. Once moderator accounts are created, a list of them will be made public. For now, only trust private messages from <code>@@root:matrix.mkn8rn.com</code> as warnings.</p>

                <h6>1. Speech and Content</h6>
                <p>This space is moderated to survive. Speech is permitted only insofar as it does not threaten continuity, reputation, safety, or focus. Keep personal information, high-friction low-value topics, and potentially insensitive content. Enforcement decisions are final and not subject to public debate.</p>
                <p class="text-muted small"><strong>Examples of inappropriate behaviour:</strong></p>
                <ul class="text-muted small">
                    <li>Political commentary, culture-war topics, or media outrage</li>
                    <li>Sharing personal data, legal issues, or accusations publicly</li>
                    <li>Edgy humour, irony, or "just joking" content that creates friction</li>
                    <li>Repeated derailment of technical or learning-focused discussions</li>
                    <li>Any mention of anything sexual or romantic</li>
                </ul>

                <h6>2. Authority and Truth</h6>
                <p>Each member is responsible for determining what is true using their own reasoning. You may provide sources, data, or references, but not demand agreement or compliance. Authority is not implied by seniority, visibility, or output. Only moderators define rules and enforce them. If discussion becomes unproductive, disengagement is the correct response.</p>

                <p>This community is not a resource pool to be extracted from. Participation does not entitle you to attention, answers, mentorship, or labour from others. Contributions are expected to be reciprocal over time, and persistent imbalance may result in removal. The community exists for collaboration, not consumption. If you cannot contribute, then pay.</p>
